# candidate-pipeline1

## Description
This project implements a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The goal is to ensure that quality checks are met before merging code into important branches. The pipeline runs component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the `develop` branch and automatically deploys the application when code is merged from `develop` to the `main` branch.
